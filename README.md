### The Problem statement
Challenge:

‚ÄúUtilize AI tools to design a basic UI for a movie streaming platform dashboard.‚Äù

Requirements:
	1.	Generate UI Components:
	‚Ä¢	Use an AI tool like ChatGPT to generate HTML and CSS code snippets for essential UI components, such as:
	‚Ä¢	Navigation bar
	‚Ä¢	Movie thumbnail grid
	‚Ä¢	Search bar
	‚Ä¢	Genre filter buttons
	2.	Assemble the Layout:
	‚Ä¢	Combine the generated code snippets into a cohesive layout using a code editor.
	‚Ä¢	Ensure the layout is responsive and visually appealing.
	3.	Incorporate Placeholder Content:
	‚Ä¢	Use placeholder images and text to simulate movie titles and descriptions.

Bonus (if time allows):
	‚Ä¢	Enhance Aesthetics:
	‚Ä¢	Apply additional styling to improve the visual appeal of the dashboard.
	‚Ä¢	Add Interactivity:
	‚Ä¢	Implement basic interactivity, such as hover effects on movie thumbnails or clickable genre filters.

AI Tools to Consider:
	‚Ä¢	ChatGPT: Generate code snippets for UI components based on text prompts.
	‚Ä¢	MidJourney: Create visual assets or design inspiration based on textual descriptions.

By leveraging these AI tools, you can rapidly prototype a functional and visually appealing dashboard for a movie streaming platform within a one-hour timeframe.
